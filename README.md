# Predicting-Medical-Costs-Using-Machine-Learning-In-R

In this project I conducted a regression and decision tree analysis to understand the key factors driving medical expenses. The results were eye-opening!

ðŸ”¹ Key Findings:
âœ… Smoking is the biggest driver of medical costs, significantly increasing expenses.
âœ… Age plays a major roleâ€”older individuals incur higher healthcare costs due to chronic conditions.
âœ… BMI has a moderate impact, with higher values linked to increased medical expenses, though not as strongly as smoking or age.

ðŸ”¹ Business Implications:
ðŸ“Œ Healthcare & Insurance Companies can benefit from risk-based premium adjustments, targeted preventive care programs, and data-driven policy optimization.
ðŸ“Œ Encouraging healthy lifestyles through smoking cessation programs, fitness incentives, and preventive screenings can help lower long-term costs.
