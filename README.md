# Predicting Medical Costs Using Regression and Decision Tree Models

📌 Objective:
This project aimed to analyze and predict medical expenses using machine learning models in R. By leveraging regression analysis and decision tree modeling, I explored the key factors influencing healthcare costs and provided actionable insights for healthcare providers and insurance companies.

🔍 Key Analysis & Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
Selected only numerical variables for analysis.
Converted categorical variables (e.g., smoker, region, gender) into factor variables for proper model training.
Scaled numerical variables where necessary to improve model performance.
2️⃣ Model Development
✅ Linear Regression Model – to understand the linear relationships between medical charges and predictor variables.
✅ Decision Tree Model – to capture non-linear patterns and interactions between variables.

3️⃣ Model Evaluation
Both models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Additionally, a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values was used to compare model accuracy.

📊 Key Findings & Insights
🔹 Smoking is the strongest predictor of medical expenses – Smokers face significantly higher healthcare costs due to the increased risk of chronic illnesses such as lung disease, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer.

🔹 Age is a major cost driver – Older individuals naturally incur higher medical expenses due to aging-related health conditions, frequent hospital visits, and long-term care needs.

🔹 BMI has a moderate impact – Higher BMI is linked to obesity-related diseases like diabetes and hypertension, but it is less influential than smoking and age in determining costs.

🏥 Business & Industry Recommendations
🔹 For Healthcare Providers
✅ Invest in preventive healthcare programs to reduce long-term costs.
✅ Promote smoking cessation and weight management programs to reduce risk factors.

🔹 For Insurance Companies
✅ Implement risk-based premium pricing – charge higher premiums for smokers and offer discounts for healthy BMI levels.
✅ Provide customized insurance plans based on age, BMI, and smoking history.
✅ Use data-driven models to refine risk assessment and optimize policy pricing.

🚀 Conclusion
This project highlights the power of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. By leveraging predictive analytics, we can better understand healthcare cost patterns, design targeted interventions, and create smarter insurance policies.
